## The Dream
I grew up playing games like Mavis Beacon and Cluefinders, and I loved every minute. I haven't been able to find similar items, and those games haven't really been re-packaged for newer hardware. I want to make something inspired by those experiences that can be played right on the web.

## Stack
I'm still not fully decided as of now, but planning on Angular as the code base. A good chance of MongoDB as the database, used to store usernames and scores, and possibly even problems. Users won't be required to log in, and I'm thinking that not-logged-in users may have their scores saved for a limited time.

## Timeline
I hope to have a working website and game by the end of this school term (about 3 weeks from now). I don't expect to have anything too fancy by then, but I will continue working until I am satisfied and hopefully until others have a chance to enjoy it, too.

I have until the 16th of June to complete the project. By the end of next week (the 7th), I hope to have a working website with some CSS specifications. By the 13th, I plan to have my database hooked up and functional, and by the 16th have gameplay functionality for at least one game mode.

Each user is only able to win an award one time, so a user and award type are together unique in the award table.
