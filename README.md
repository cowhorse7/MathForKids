## The Dream
I grew up playing games like Mavis Beacon and Cluefinders, and I loved every minute. I haven't been able to find similar items, and those games haven't really been re-packaged for newer hardware. I want to make something inspired by those experiences that can be played right on the web.

## Stack
I'm still not fully decided as of now, but planning on Angular as the code base. A good chance of MongoDB as the database, used to store usernames and scores, and possibly even problems. Users won't be required to log in, and I'm thinking that not-logged-in users may have their scores saved for a limited time.

## Timeline
I hope to have a working website and game by the end of this school term (about 3 weeks from now). I don't expect to have anything too fancy by then, but I will continue working until I am satisfied and hopefully until others have a chance to enjoy it, too.
